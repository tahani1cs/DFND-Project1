# DFND-Project1
In this project, I have analyze a real dataset about current Udacity students across a number of programs, so it isn't perfect. 
It is a little messy (some things are input incorrectly, others are missing). I had need to decide how to analyze the data and then communicate my findings about it. 
I used spreadsheets to make my analysis easier.
